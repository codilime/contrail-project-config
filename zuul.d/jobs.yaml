      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.
      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ subdirectory of the executor
      work directory to the logserver.
      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).

      A generic build & packaging job for OpenContrail components

      This is a base job for all jobs building Contrail artifacts.

      This job is a cornerstone for all the jobs that build Contrail
      artifacts (packages, docker containers) based on the monolithic
      build directory structure. It takes care of moving repositories
      checked out by zuul into their expected locations, as well
      as launching the build container.
